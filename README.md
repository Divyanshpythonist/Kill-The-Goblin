# Kill-The-Goblin

A 2D game made using an inbuilt module in Python named **Pygame** .

You can download all the frames/sprites by downloading **Pygame-Images.zip** file.

You can view my step to step making of game as I've uploaded each file step-wise as follows :

 1. Basic_movement_key_presses.py
 2. Jumping_and_boundary_contraints.py
 3. Character_animation_and_sprits.py
 4. Optimization_and_oop.py
 5. projectiles.py
 6. Enemies.py
 7. Collisions_and_hit_boxes.py
 8. scoring_and_health_bars.py
 9. sound_effects_music_and_more_collisions.py
 10. final_game.py
 
 It's just a simple game, not a very great stuff but it can be a good beginning.
